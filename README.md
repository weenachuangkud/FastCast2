# FastCast2
> Unofficial continuation of FastCast for Roblox

**An improved version of [FastCast](https://etithespir.it/FastCastAPIDocs/)** with **Parallel scripting**, **more extensions**, and **statically typed**. <br /> **A powerful modern projectile** library


**FastCast2** It's a **Roblox projectile library** powered by [VMsDispatcher](https://github.com/weenachuangkud/VMsDispatcher) designed to simulate **thousands** of projectiles without relying on physics replication. <br />
Because FastCast is no longer actively maintained by [EtiTheSpirit](https://github.com/EtiTheSpirit), this repository continues the project with updates and adaptations.

<br />
