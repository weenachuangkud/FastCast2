# FastCast2 (Unofficial) 
**An improved version of [FastCast](https://etithespir.it/FastCastAPIDocs/)** with **Parallel scripting**, **more extensions**, and **statically typed**, **A powerful modern projectile** library


**FastCast2** It's a projectiles library powered by [VMsDispatcher](https://github.com/weenachuangkud/VMsDispatcher) designed to simulate **thousands** of projectiles without relying on **physics replication**.

Because FastCast is no longer actively maintained by [EtiTheSpirit](https://github.com/EtiTheSpirit), this repository continues the project with updates and adaptations.

- Raycast and Blockcast support
- BulkMoveTo support
- Built-in ObjectCache

- Improves development productivity
