# Contributing to FastCast2

**Thank you** for considering contributing to FastCast2!  
This project is open-source and community-driven, and **all kinds of help are welcome** — code, documentation, bug reports, examples, ideas, or even just spreading the word.

### How to Contribute

1. **Found a bug? Have an idea?**
   - Open an **Issue** first (bug report, feature request, question, etc.)
   - Use a clear title and describe the problem/suggestion in detail

2. **Want to submit code or docs?**
   - Fork the repository
   - Create a new branch for your work  
     `git checkout -b fix/something` or `git checkout -b feature/new-cool-things`
   - Make your changes
   - Commit your changes (see commit message guidelines below)
   - Push to your fork
   - Open a **Pull Request** against the `main` branch

All pull requests will go through **code review** before merging.

### Code Review Expectations

- Code should be **clean, readable, and follow existing style** (Luau typing, naming conventions, etc.)
- New features should have **basic tests** (when applicable) or clear usage examples
- Documentation should be updated if the public API changes
- Keep PRs **focused** — one feature/fix per pull request is ideal
- Be prepared to make changes based on feedback

### Commit Message Guidelines

Examples:
- `fix: prevent nil reference in ObjectCache`
- `feat: add BulkMoveTo support for parts.`
- `docs: improve usage example for parallel mode.`
- `chore: update Luau types in Caster.`
(It's recommended to follow this Instruction guideline, but you can make lazy commits if you want, because even the main developer still does that)

### Rules

- **Be respectful** — to everyone (maintainers, other contributors, users)
- No personal attacks, harassment, or toxic behavior
- Keep discussions technical and constructive

### Questions?

Feel free to ask anything:
- An **Issue** on GitHub
- The [DevForum thread](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/fastcast2-an-improved-version-of-fastcast-with-parallel-scripting-more-extensions-and-statically-typed/4093890)
- Or ping me directly

Thanks again for helping make FastCast2 better!
