# Introduction

**FastCast2** It's a **Roblox projectile library** powered by [VMsDispatcher](https://github.com/weenachuangkud/VMsDispatcher) designed to simulate **thousands** of projectiles without relying on physics replication.

Because FastCast is no longer actively maintained by [EtiTheSpirit](https://github.com/EtiTheSpirit), this repository continues the project with updates and adaptations.
